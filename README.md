## Hi, I'm Bridget Ho! ðŸ‘‹

### About Me
I graduated from Northeastern University with a B.S. in Psychology, and minors in Behavioral Neuroscience and Biology.
I'm currently a UX Research co-lead on the Async project with Tech Fleet Community DAO.

I love learning new technologies, and I'm currently learning the foundations of front-end development with The Odin Project! 

I'm interested in Human Computer Interaction (HCI), and am currently applying for master's programs in this field.
